Birthdays widget plugin produces a widget which displays a customizable happy birthday image and wish to your clients/users.

== Description ==

Birthdays Widget allows to add your custom birthday-list and display a custom message in 
a widget or a shortcode in every page always or only when it's necessary.
WordPress Users can also have a birthday date field, or you can even draw their birthday date 
from another of their metafields (even BuddyPress xProfile fields).

Features:

* **Integration with WordPress User Profile, Gravatar or profile image through WordPress Media Manger**
* **Integration with BuddyPress User Profile and date field generated by it**
* **Integration with any WordPress User metafield generated by other plugins. Date format should be saved as WordPress Date Format in settings**
* **Powerful table enhanced by DataTables.js for fast and easy administration of Birthdays Records**
* **3 different modes: List (with User's Image), Calendar for all year Birthdays, Upcoming Birthdays, Default comma separated Birthdays of current day**
* **Customizable message, image for widget and verbiage and images for Users**
* **Controlled access to Birthday Admin Table with WordPress custom capability**
* **Import/Export from/to CSV file**
* **Greek, English Languages (please feel free to contribute)**

Some use our plugin as an announcement tool or as work anniversary reminder, as you can modify the message, the image shown in widget and the verbiage to Users.
